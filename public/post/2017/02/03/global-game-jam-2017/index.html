<h2 id="global-game-jam-i-m-back">Global Game Jam, I&rsquo;m back</h2>

<p>(I know, I&rsquo;m late into this party)</p>

<p>Usually, when you have a great time at an event, you really want to go back there
next year. That&rsquo;s exactly what happened with the Global Game Jam. I went last year
and I really had a blast. Last year I went to the swiss <a href="https://twitter.com/GGJSuisse">&ldquo;Castle Jam&rdquo;</a>
in La Tour-de-Peilz.</p>

<p>This year, they had to go a bit bigger, as the number of paricipants went up quite a bit. We moved
to the castle of Yverdon-Les-Bains.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ggj17/yverdon.jpg" alt="The castle of Yverdon" /></p>

<p>We went with almost the same team as last year, only one of our teammates couldn&rsquo;t make it this
year because of his exams. So we went with this team :</p>

<ol>
<li>Antoine and I did all the programming (I&rsquo;ll talk about that a bit later)</li>
<li>Chloé and Lionel did all the graphics,</li>
<li>Anthony did the music and the playtests.</li>
</ol>

<p>We had a small meeting the week before just so we could talk about what kind of game we
could/wanted to do. We talked quite a lot and shared ideas while showing games we liked.
(which could be used as inspiration).</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t want to make the same mistakes that we did last year and decided to go with
a shooter/shoot-them-up type of game. We could use the game engine we used last year (Phaser.js)
because we already had some experience with it and many examples and help is available.</p>

<p>More importantly, it&rsquo;s a game that can be prototyped quickly (at least faster than last year&rsquo;s game)
and this would allow us to iterate more and correct some problems while developing the game.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ggj17/apocalypse_miaou.png" alt="Apocalypse Miaou" /></p>

<p>This is the game we made during this week-end, Apocalypse Miaou, a side scrolling shooter featuring
two felines punishing the filthy humans for messing with the climate. This game has a lion wearing sunglasses that
rides a rocket while shooting a submachine gun&hellip; you can&rsquo;t get more awesome than that.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a short video of the game (it&rsquo;s a bit slugish)</p>

</iframe>

<p>As you can see, it&rsquo;s quite dynamic with a fast pace.</p>

<p>I think we came up with something pretty good. Keep in mind that this is our second game
jam and our second game&hellip; ever. At the end, the game is playable but kinda difficult.
The difficulty isn&rsquo;t balanced out and the waves of ennemies aren&rsquo;t really well defined.</p>

<p>This taught us a lot about game and level design. Creating a level that is not too easy
or not too hard isn&rsquo;t as easy as it seems and it requires quite a lot of testing.</p>

<p>Again, we learned a lot this year and got even more experience. We&rsquo;ll come back next year
and make something even better.</p>

<p>As a final note, I&rsquo;d like to say thank you to Chloé, Lionel and Anthony, because they let Antoine and I
crash at their place. I&rsquo;d like to thanks the organizers of this year&rsquo;s Castle Jam and also
say thanks to all the people who tried our game and gave us feedbacks.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ll keep working on this game and try to make it better. Add more levels, add sounds etc.</p>
