<p>If you take a look at some results on google or if you browse reddit on a regular basis, you&rsquo;ve probably came across a blog post or a forum thread entitled <em>Why PHP sucks</em> or <em>PHP is the worst programming language ever</em>, <em>Stop using PHP please</em> etc&hellip;.</p>

<p>In fact, if you type <em>PHP is bad</em> in google , this is what you get :</p>

<p><img src="/images/phphate/1.png" alt="A screenshot of the menu" /></p>

<p>As Google says : It&rsquo;s <em>about</em> 367&rsquo;000&rsquo;000 results but if you take a look at the results on the first page you get the idea, a lot of people hate PHP. Some hate it for valid reasons and others are just plain stupid elitists who rant on every other software than their own.</p>

<h2 id="yes-php-used-to-be-bad">Yes, PHP used to be bad</h2>

<p>Just to make things clear, I started tinkering with PHP with version 5.3 in 2010 I think, so I never worked with older versions of the language. (No I don&rsquo;t use PHP4 constructors) But, it is not difficult to find old PHP code on the internet, just take a look at the PEAR libraries.</p>

<p>The fact is, PHP didn&rsquo;t really start as a full-blown programming language, It was just a set of tools named <em>Personal Home Page Tools</em> which have grown over time in a programming language. That explains the inconsistent naming and weird ordering of functions parameters. And I must admit there is some stuff I don&rsquo;t like about this language :</p>

<ul>
<li>The names of built-in functions are inconsistent (isset(), is_null())</li>
<li>Functions arguments are inconsistent</li>
<li>Case-insensitive functions but case-sensitive variables</li>
<li>Other minor details</li>
</ul>

<p><code>&lt;rant&gt;</code> They say PHP is bad but Javascript is <a href="https://vimeo.com/111122950">filled with quirky stuff</a> as well and it still is one of the most trending language at the moment <code>&lt;/rant&gt;</code></p>

<h2 id="php-is-popular">PHP is popular</h2>

<p>Yes, this is something you can&rsquo;t deny, PHP is very popular on the web thanks to a lot of hosting companies. What makes the language so popular in my opinion is the combo : Shared hosting providers / Wordpress.</p>

<p>Most hosting providers support the LAMP stack by default and you just have to drag and drop the files on the server and you&rsquo;re good to go. Some of theme even offer those one-click install of Wordpress and other CMS. This contribute to this high &ldquo;Market share&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="legacy-projects">Legacy projects</h2>

<p>This is one of the things that gives PHP a bad reputation : The old, crappy, poorly coded, bug ridden legacy projects. At my current job, I&rsquo;m in charge of an old project written in PHP that doesn&rsquo;t use any framework or libraries (completely built from scratch), has no correct routing (every page is a subfolder), and doesn&rsquo;t use a templating engine (a lot of <code>&lt;php echo $var ?&gt;</code> in the middle of the html).</p>

<p>The tweet below pretty much sums it up.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="fr"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Current status : pulling my hair out and loading my shotgun&hellip;. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/code?src=hash">#code</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/codinghorror?src=hash">#codinghorror</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/programming?src=hash">#programming</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/horror?src=hash">#horror</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wtf?src=hash">#wtf</a> <a href="https://t.co/pYeZRslvRi">pic.twitter.com/pYeZRslvRi</a></p>&mdash; $this-getCthulhu(); (@dupertuiseric) <a href="https://twitter.com/dupertuiseric/status/683970594145198080">4 janvier 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Sadly, the internet is filled with such legacy crap and I can&rsquo;t blame anyone who worked on such project to develop nothing but pure hatred for PHP.</p>

<h2 id="if-the-code-is-bad-there-s-a-reason">If the code is bad, there&rsquo;s a reason</h2>

<p>Ok so this applies to all programming languages, If your code is bad, don&rsquo;t blame the language. If your C program overload the memory, <em>you</em> did something bad, not the language, not the C compiler. (or you clearly not have enough RAM and <em>you</em> are responsible)</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s what I want to say : There&rsquo;s too much bad PHP code out there (did I say wordpress ?) and too many projects filled with poorly designed codebase. Also, if you search for a PHP tutorial on google, you&rsquo;ll find hundreds of tutorials that doesn&rsquo;t teach you what the language can do and many of these will even give you perfect examples of what you shouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about PHP, at first I would learn the basics (syntax, conditions and loops) and then move to a good tutorial such as <a href="http://www.phptherightway.com/">Php The Right Way</a></p>

<h2 id="things-got-better">Things got better</h2>

<p>Hell yeah things got better, coding in PHP on a modern project is awesome. I work on a regular basis on Symfony 2 projects at work and with Laravel at home as well and I can really say that it becomes a real pleasure to create web applications and solve problems with them. If we take a look at a Symfony 2 project, we find everything a modern application has such as an MVC pattern, a package manager, CLI utilities and much more.</p>

<p>The latest versions really tried to make the language cleaner (go take a look at the improvements in PHP 7)</p>

<h2 id="everything-sucks">Everything sucks</h2>

<p>In the community of web development (and software development as well), everything sucks all the time. People say <em>ruby is slow it sucks</em>, <em>OOP is stupid, functional programming is better</em>, <em>Java sucks</em> etc&hellip; And don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love trolling Java users from time to time but still, great projects exists with Java (PhpStorm and other JetBrains IDE, Jenkins, elasticsearch among those I use) and if you managed to solve your problem with it, then great, don&rsquo;t lose your time with people telling you your language is bad.</p>

<p>I use other languages, I&rsquo;m not a PHP integrist or crazy fanboy but if, by using PHP, I can create my websites, my web apps and other projects without too much hassle, then it&rsquo;s good for me.</p>
