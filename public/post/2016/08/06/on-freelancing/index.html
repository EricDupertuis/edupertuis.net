<p>I&rsquo;ve been freelancing on the side of my professional training for two years now, doing mainly web design and web development. I&rsquo;ve decided to stop (at least the big projects) but I&rsquo;ve learned a lot in two years. I&rsquo;m pretty sure many people have encountered the problems that I faced way before me but I&rsquo;m going the write about it anyway.</p>

<h2 id="be-a-full-time-freelancer-or-don-t-be">Be a full-time freelancer, or don&rsquo;t be</h2>

<p>Swinging between being a trainee (I&rsquo;m learning my job part time in a company and part-time in a school) and a freelancer was one of the worst idea ever.</p>

<p>First of all, you&rsquo;re busy all day and you can&rsquo;t work on your freelance projects during business hours. So you work during your break (which isn&rsquo;t a real break then), your morning commute, your evening commute, when you get home at 7pm and during the weekends. Then you start again the next day&hellip; This can become really frustrating and can lead you to a burnout.</p>

<p>This was driving me crazy because I didn&rsquo;t really have much time to myself anymore. I bought a new gaming rig at the beginning of 2016 (a 1500$ setup) and I couldn&rsquo;t really enjoy it. I couldn&rsquo;t watch an episode of a TV series in the train anymore, because I was working now. I couldn&rsquo;t read much as well (I&rsquo;ve read only one book in 2016 yet&hellip; pathetic).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t intend to work as a freelancer again soon, but if, one day, I decided to start again, I would work full-time, not on the side of something else.</p>

<h2 id="the-client-needs-you-more-than-you-need-him">The client needs you more than you need him</h2>

<p>I wish I knew this at first, but a lot of work is available as a freelancer, I looked for work at first, but then you get a little circle of regular clients, who sometimes recommend you to other people, so on and so on. Soon, work comes to you (at least in the field I&rsquo;m in).</p>

<p>I would work ridiculous hours when it wasn&rsquo;t worth it because I was pretty sure I couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose a client&hellip; I was wrong. Get rid of the clients which ask for absurd things, get rid of those who asks for unpaid overtime, get rid of those who ask for free stuff.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying you should get rid of your first client, but as soon as your &ldquo;reputation&rdquo; is made, don&rsquo;t feel the obligation to do everything a client asks, set clear limits, proof read every contracts and requests.</p>

<h2 id="don-t-jump-on-already-existing-projects">Don&rsquo;t jump on already existing projects</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned this the hard way&hellip; twice.</p>

<p>I got into two projects that were already in place and well advanced. Both situations were pretty similar: I was hired to fix broken things and finish the latest features. But when you get in a two years old PHP project that five developers have worked om (everyone off them in a different way), you don&rsquo;t want to be there to patch things up.</p>

<p>If I would start again, I would do simpler projects, but do them from start to finish.</p>

<h2 id="don-t-get-into-oversized-projects">Don&rsquo;t get into oversized projects</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get into a project that would require 5 developers if you&rsquo;re alone. This might seem obvious, but you should know your limits and therefore, refuse to work on projects that are bigger than you.</p>

<h2 id="a-finale-note">A finale note</h2>

<p>Freelancing is great but it&rsquo;s a lot of &ldquo;Die and retry&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll get bad clients but also very good clients that you&rsquo;ll love to work with. You&rsquo;ll get bad projects with unrealistic deadlines and features but you&rsquo;ll also get great and challenging projects. Take time to detect which projects and clients will be a good fit for you, don&rsquo;t hesitate to take time to discuss a lot about every projects and don&rsquo;t forget to get some time off, your brain will thank you for that.</p>
