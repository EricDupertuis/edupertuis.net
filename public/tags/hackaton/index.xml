      <description>Global Game Jam, I&amp;rsquo;m back (I know, I&amp;rsquo;m late into this party)
Usually, when you have a great time at an event, you really want to go back there next year. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what happened with the Global Game Jam. I went last year and I really had a blast. Last year I went to the swiss &amp;ldquo;Castle Jam&amp;rdquo; in La Tour-de-Peilz.
This year, they had to go a bit bigger, as the number of paricipants went up quite a bit.</description>

      <description>A first Global Game Jam So for me, this year started pretty well. I registered for the 2016 Global Game Jam.
Just to put things in perspective : I never made a video game and neither did my team mates.
We came in with a pretty heterogeneous team : Two graphic designers, a sys-admin, a biologist, a robotics engineer and a web-dev (me). None of us ever made game graphics, wrote game engines or even made music for a video game but we didn&amp;rsquo;t really care about that, we wanted to do this for the challenge.</description>
