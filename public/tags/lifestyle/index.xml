      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been freelancing on the side of my professional training for two years now, doing mainly web design and web development. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to stop (at least the big projects) but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot in two years. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure many people have encountered the problems that I faced way before me but I&amp;rsquo;m going the write about it anyway.
Be a full-time freelancer, or don&amp;rsquo;t be Swinging between being a trainee (I&amp;rsquo;m learning my job part time in a company and part-time in a school) and a freelancer was one of the worst idea ever.</description>
